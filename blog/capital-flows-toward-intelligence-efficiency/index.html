        <p>Capital is not sentimental. It does not care about legacy. It does not reward effort. It moves toward efficiency and away from friction.</p>

        <p>In the Exponential Age, the efficiency that matters most is intelligence efficiency: the ratio of value created to cognitive resources consumed.</p>

        <p>Companies that understand this will capture disproportionate value. Those that don't will wonder where the capital went.</p>

        <h2>The New Metric</h2>

        <p>For decades, markets measured companies by revenue, growth, and profit margins. These metrics assumed human labor as the primary input. More employees meant more capacity. Headcount was a proxy for capability.</p>

        <p>That assumption is breaking down.</p>

        <p>In an AI-abundant world, the question is no longer "how many people do you employ?" but "how much intelligence do you deploy per dollar of cost?"</p>

        <p>A company with 50 people leveraging AI effectively can outcompete a company with 500 people using traditional methods. Markets are beginning to price this difference.</p>

        <h2>What Capital Sees</h2>

        <p>Sophisticated capital allocators are now evaluating:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>AI leverage ratio</strong> — How much does each employee's output multiply through AI tools?</li>
          <li><strong>Automation coverage</strong> — What percentage of processes can scale without linear headcount growth?</li>
          <li><strong>Intelligence infrastructure</strong> — Is the company building systems that compound, or just using tools?</li>
          <li><strong>Structural adaptability</strong> — Can the organization restructure quickly as AI capabilities expand?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These aren't standard metrics yet. But they're becoming the hidden variables that explain valuation divergences.</p>

        <h2>The Migration Pattern</h2>

        <p>Capital migration happens in waves:</p>

        <p><strong>Wave 1: Tool adoption.</strong> Companies buy AI tools. This is table stakes. No competitive advantage.</p>

        <p><strong>Wave 2: Process automation.</strong> Companies automate workflows. This creates efficiency gains but is easily copied.</p>

        <p><strong>Wave 3: Structural redesign.</strong> Companies rebuild their architecture around intelligence abundance. This creates durable advantage.</p>

        <p>Most companies are stuck in waves 1 and 2. The capital advantage goes to those reaching wave 3.</p>

        <blockquote>
          "The companies that win aren't those that use AI the most. They're those that need humans the least for tasks that AI can do better."
        </blockquote>

        <h2>Markets as Measurement Systems</h2>

        <p>Here's a useful frame: markets are measurement systems. They constantly evaluate and price every company's fitness for the current environment.</p>

        <p>When the environment changes, the measurement criteria change. Companies optimized for old criteria get marked down. Those optimized for new criteria get marked up.</p>

        <p>We are in a measurement regime change. The criteria are shifting from labor efficiency to intelligence efficiency.</p>

        <p>Companies that understand this can position ahead of the repricing. They can structure themselves to score well on the new metrics before those metrics become consensus.</p>

        <h2>Positioning for the Shift</h2>

        <p>If you're building a company:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Design for minimal human involvement in scalable processes</li>
          <li>Build intelligence infrastructure that compounds</li>
          <li>Create organizational structures that can evolve as AI capabilities expand</li>
          <li>Measure and optimize for intelligence efficiency, not headcount</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you're allocating capital:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Look for companies reaching wave 3</li>
          <li>Evaluate intelligence leverage, not just AI adoption</li>
          <li>Discount companies structurally dependent on human scaling</li>
          <li>Overweight companies that can grow output without proportional headcount</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Arbitrage Window</h2>

        <p>There's a window right now. The old measurement criteria still dominate public narratives. Traditional metrics still drive most valuations. But sophisticated allocators are already using new frameworks.</p>

        <p>This creates arbitrage. Companies that position for intelligence efficiency are undervalued by old metrics and fairly valued by new ones. As the new metrics become consensus, these companies get repriced upward.</p>

        <p>The window won't stay open forever. As the shift becomes obvious, the arbitrage closes.</p>

        <p>Capital flows toward intelligence efficiency. Position accordingly.</p>
