        <p>Energy became compute. Compute became intelligence. Now intelligence is escaping the institutional containers built for a different era.</p>

        <p>This is not a metaphor. It is the central economic fact of our time.</p>

        <p>For centuries, the scarcest resource was human cognitive capacity. Institutions, companies, and markets were designed around this constraint. We built hierarchies to route decisions to limited pools of expertise. We created universities to slowly replicate knowledge. We structured corporations around the assumption that intelligent work required humans, and humans were expensive and hard to scale.</p>

        <p>That constraint is dissolving.</p>

        <h2>The Container Problem</h2>

        <p>Institutions are containers for scarce intelligence. They were optimized for a world where:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Expertise took decades to develop</li>
          <li>Knowledge transfer was slow and lossy</li>
          <li>Decision-making capacity was limited by human cognition</li>
          <li>Coordination required hierarchies because communication was expensive</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Every major institution—corporations, universities, governments, markets—carries the architectural assumptions of this scarcity.</p>

        <p>But intelligence is no longer scarce. It is becoming abundant, cheap, and infinitely replicable.</p>

        <h2>What Abundance Changes</h2>

        <p>When intelligence becomes abundant, the constraints shift. The new scarce resources are:</p>

        <p><strong>Coherence.</strong> In a world of infinite content and analysis, the ability to maintain consistent direction and avoid fragmentation becomes decisive.</p>

        <p><strong>Taste.</strong> When anyone can generate, the ability to curate and judge quality becomes more valuable than the ability to produce.</p>

        <p><strong>Verification.</strong> When AI can produce convincing anything, trust and verification systems become critical infrastructure.</p>

        <p><strong>Energy.</strong> Intelligence runs on compute. Compute runs on energy. The ultimate constraint remains physical.</p>

        <h2>The Escape Velocity Problem</h2>

        <p>Here's what most people miss: intelligence doesn't just become cheaper within existing containers. It escapes them entirely.</p>

        <p>A corporation designed around 10,000 employees making decisions cannot simply "add AI" and become more efficient. The fundamental architecture assumes human decision-making at every node. Adding AI doesn't optimize this system—it makes the system obsolete.</p>

        <p>The winning move is not to optimize old containers. It is to design new ones.</p>

        <blockquote>
          "The companies that win the next decade will not be those that adopt AI fastest. They will be those that redesign their entire structure around intelligence abundance."
        </blockquote>

        <h2>What New Containers Look Like</h2>

        <p>The new institutional forms are already emerging. They share common characteristics:</p>

        <p><strong>Intelligence-first architecture.</strong> Instead of designing for humans with AI assistance, they design for AI with human oversight. The default assumption flips.</p>

        <p><strong>Coherence mechanisms.</strong> They invest heavily in maintaining alignment and direction as scale increases. Culture, values, and explicit coordination become load-bearing infrastructure.</p>

        <p><strong>Programmable incentives.</strong> They use tokens, equity, and algorithmic systems to align behavior rather than relying on management hierarchies.</p>

        <p><strong>Network effects on intelligence.</strong> They build systems where more users create better AI, which attracts more users. Data becomes the moat.</p>

        <h2>The Transition Period</h2>

        <p>We are in an awkward transition. Old institutions still control most resources and regulatory frameworks. New institutions are emerging but lack legitimacy and scale. The friction between these creates the characteristic chaos of our moment.</p>

        <p>This transition will not be smooth. But it will be fast. The institutions that figure out new containers first will compound their advantages. Those that try to preserve old architectures will find their constraints increasingly binding as the world accelerates around them.</p>

        <h2>What To Do</h2>

        <p>If you're building a company, ask yourself: am I optimizing an old container, or designing a new one?</p>

        <p>If you're investing capital, ask yourself: does this business assume intelligence scarcity, or intelligence abundance?</p>

        <p>If you're operating an existing institution, ask yourself: what would we build if we started today with no legacy constraints?</p>

        <p>The answers to these questions will determine who thrives in the Exponential Age.</p>

        <p>Intelligence is escaping old containers. The only question is whether you'll be building the new ones, or trapped in the old.</p>
